# Teamwork Project Assignment ( [Java Funda](https://softuni.bg/courses/java-basics/) [mentals Course @ SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/courses/java-basics/))

Design and implement **a Java-based game** by choice. It could be a well-known game like Minesweeper, Tetris or Xonix or a game designed by your team.

You, as a team, are **free to decide** what platforms, development tools and team collaboration tools will use. You might perform live meetings in SoftUni or at some other location, online meetings, use chat systems, organize mailing lists, Facebook groups, use project management tools, source control tools and any other technical and non-technical resources to build your project, but please **work in team**. Each team member should be able to **prove his or her contribution** at the project live defense. Remember that each team member will get **equal score** at the project public defense.

## General Requirements

- **Use Java** – the entire work should be implemented in Java
- **GUI or console-based application**
  - You may use some Java GUI library like Java FX, Swing or AWT
- **Work in team** – all team members should contribute

## Deliverables

Put the following in a **ZIP archive** and submit it (each team member submits the same file):

- The complete **source code** of your project.

  - Project name and purpose – what you have created?
